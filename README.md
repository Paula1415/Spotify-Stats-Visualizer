# Spotify-stats-visualizer

### Have you ever wondered how your music sounds compared to the top hits?

Spotistats performs an audio analysis in your top 50 most listened tracks from spotify, and compares the track in a visual way to playlists such as Top Daily Hits or Top 50: Global.

if you want to set it up locally you can:

1. fork the repo
2. clone it to your local machine
3. run `pip install requirements.txt`

Notice, that because requesting data to the spotify api my take a while, so the loading times will be slower.

all the secret variables are stored in the .env file, you can create yours or use the ones already on the file.

soon we will have this project deployed.
